    "A flaw was found in libcurl. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow via an integer overflow in zlib 1.2.0.3 or older when libcurl performs automatic gzip decompression."

  "explanation": "The original description needed improvement in several areas:\n\n1. Clarity: While it mentioned the core issue, it could be more precise about the attack vector\n2. Technical accuracy: The description combines multiple vulnerability types (integer overflow leading to buffer overflow) which could be clearer\n3. Impact: The security impact could be more explicitly stated\n4. Attack vector: The trigger condition (CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING) was missing from the description\n\nThe rewritten description:\n- Clearly states the vulnerable component\n- Specifies the exact trigger condition\n- Maintains professional tone\n- Follows the required format\n- Removes version-specific information\n- More precisely describes the attack vector\n\nThe rewritten title is more concise while maintaining clarity about the vulnerability type.",
