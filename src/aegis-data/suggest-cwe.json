  "title": "Buffer Overflow in libcurl via zlib Integer Overflow",
  "components": [
    "libcurl"
  ],
  "explanation": "This vulnerability exhibits characteristics of both CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) and CWE-119 (Buffer Overflow). The primary weakness is CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) which leads to a buffer overflow condition. The vulnerability occurs when libcurl processes gzip-compressed HTTP responses using an older version of zlib (1.2.0.3 or older). The integer overflow in the decompression process subsequently causes a buffer overflow, making this a classic example of an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The integer overflow is the root cause that enables the buffer overflow condition.",
