# OpenAPI Generator Ignore for OSIDB API
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# Ignore API client files - we only want models/types
apis/
index.ts
runtime.ts

# Keep only:
# - models/ (for type definitions)
